# LangGraph Email Assistant

**Infosys Springboard Internship Project**  

LangGraph Email Assistant is an AI-powered email triaging and management system developed as part of my internship at **Infosys Springboard**. The assistant leverages the **LangChain ecosystem** (LangGraph, LangSmith, and Agents) to intelligently classify emails, suggest responses, and enable human-in-the-loop (HITL) review for accurate decision-making.

## Features
- Automated email triaging and classification.
- Human-in-the-loop interface for review and approval.
- Trace logging and observability using LangSmith.
- AI-driven response suggestions.
- Modular and scalable architecture for easy enhancements.

## Technologies
- Python
- LangChain Ecosystem (LangGraph, LangSmith, Agents)
- Streamlit / FastAPI for HITL UI
- Docker for containerization
- Git & GitHub for version control
